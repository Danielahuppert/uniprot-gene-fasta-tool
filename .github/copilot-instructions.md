<!-- GitHub Copilot instructions for the "uniprot-gene-fasta-tool" repository -->

# Repository summary

Repository name: `uniprot-gene-fasta-tool`

Purpose: small Python CLI that fetches or converts UniProt entries by gene to FASTA sequences. Primary entry points are `uniprot_cli.py` (CLI) and `uniprot_logic.py` (core logic).

Primary files to inspect before suggesting code changes:

- `uniprot_cli.py`  CLI argument parsing and user-facing commands
- `uniprot_logic.py`  core functions that implement the fetching/conversion logic
- `requirements.txt`  pinned dependencies and Python target

# Coding style and constraints

- Keep changes small and focused. Prefer simple, readable code over clever one-liners.
- Follow existing project style: plain Python, no unnecessary external dependencies.
- Target compatibility with Python versions indicated in `requirements.txt` (if not explicit, assume Python 3.8+).
- Avoid changing public CLI flags or file layout unless adding backward-compatible options.
- Do not add large binary files, secrets, or credentials.

# Tests and verification

- This repository currently does not include a test suite. When adding behavior, also add a small, fast unit test where practical (use `unittest` or `pytest`).
- Verify basic behavior manually by running the CLI help and a simple command locally:

  - PowerShell example to show help:

    ```powershell
    python .\uniprot_cli.py --help
    ```

  - Example run (replace with actual flags supported in the CLI):

    ```powershell
    python .\uniprot_cli.py --gene BRCA1 --output brca1.fasta
    ```

# When to create or modify files

- If adding features, place code in `uniprot_logic.py` and keep `uniprot_cli.py` as a thin interface layer.
- If adding configuration, prefer a simple format (environment variables or a small JSON/TOML file); do not introduce heavy configuration frameworks.

# Security and network

- Network calls should validate and handle errors robustly (timeouts, retries, and descriptive error messages). Do not hardcode API keys or credentials.

# Commit message guidance

- Keep commit messages concise and descriptive. Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add FASTA header normalization").

# For Copilot suggestions

- Prefer suggestions that:
  - Use existing project functions and patterns.
  - Are minimal, well-tested, and include clear error handling.
  - Avoid introducing new third-party dependencies without a clear benefit.

- Avoid suggestions that:
  - Drastically change the CLI or public behavior without a migration path.
  - Add heavy frameworks, CI, or build tooling unless requested.

# Contacts and context

If unsure about intent, inspect recent commits or the README for usage examples. Ask the developer to clarify expected CLI flags or output formats before making breaking changes.
